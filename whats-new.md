**Showing Polymarket Clarifications in the Voter dApp**

We’ve updated the voter dApp to show Polymarket clarifications right within the dApp to ensure that all UMA voters have access to the same critical information before voting on disputes.

{% step %}
**Increased the Settlement Price Approval Threshold (SPAT)**

The Settlement Price Approval Threshold (SPAT) is basically the level of agreement needed among voters to resolve a dispute. Before now, the OO used to accept a simple majority (50%+), which meant disputes could be resolved, even on rare occasions when opinions were pretty divided.&#x20;

We’ve now raised SPAT to 65% to strengthen the required consensus for vote outcomes. If we don't hit that threshold, the vote "rolls" to another round, giving everyone time to reconsider and discuss until there’s a stronger community agreement.

{% step %}
**Enhanced Voter Information and Warnings**

We've added clear warnings and guidance for voters within the dApp to help voters understand that they have a responsibility to verify claims independently.

{% step %}
**Improved Discussion Environment**

We've updated how discussions are sorted in the voter dApp; instead of the initial chronological order where the earliest comments are seen first in the discussion pane, users can now sort from the most recent

{% step %}
**Fixed PM Market Linking**

We've resolved technical issues with links to Polymarket markets, ensuring voters can easily access the associated market information directly from the voter dApp. This provides crucial context about market odds and trading activity.
