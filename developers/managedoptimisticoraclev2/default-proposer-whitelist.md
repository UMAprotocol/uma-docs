# Default Proposer Whitelist

Risk Labs manages the default proposer whitelist for Polymarket's ManagedOptimisticOracleV2 contract. The current guidelines for 3rd party addresses to be included on this whitelist are having 5 or more proposals on OptimisticOracleV2 or ManagedOptimisticOracleV2 with a proposal accuracy greater than 95% in the last 6 months.

The current whitelist can be viewed [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9f35885ce8f67a942d7b2f4fbf937987da08c463#readContract#F1) and is subject to periodic updates and changes in guidelines. Polymarket, as the request manager for the contract, may also change an unproposed requestâ€™s proposer whitelist at any time.
