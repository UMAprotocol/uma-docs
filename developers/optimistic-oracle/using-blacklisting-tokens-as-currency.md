# Using Blacklisting Tokens as Currency

Using a token that allows backlisting (e.g. USDC) as your [requestPrice](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L120) `currency` opens up a griefing vector that integrators should be aware of.&#x20;

The [`proposePriceFor`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L304) and [`disputePriceFor`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L382) functions allow the caller to set any address as the `proposer` and `disputer` that will receive payouts if their proposal/dispute is correct upon settlement. If a bad actor calls both [`proposePriceFor`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L304) and [`disputePriceFor`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L382) and specifies a blacklisted address for repayment, the [settle](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/dd9d1fa988d8520ad36db145db13591e9a104fa9/packages/core/contracts/optimistic-oracle-v2/implementation/OptimisticOracleV2.sol#L498) function will revert and cause the request to be frozen unless the address is unblacklisted. This costs the malicious user 2 bonds and does not result in any gain, but freezing the request could cause issues for the integrator.&#x20;

To avoid this, integrations that use tokens with blacklisting functionality should ensure that their admins can call a function that ignores the frozen request and creates a new OOV2 request. In this way they can prevent a frozen request from having any negative consequences to their protocol.
