# DAO Proposals

The UMA DAO accepts proposals for on-chain actions that require tokenholders approval. An example would be a request for funding from the UMA treasury. The steps to complete a proposal:

**Step 1: Post to Discourse**

The first step is making a post in the UMA discourse under [non-technical UMIPs](https://discourse.umaproject.org/c/uma-protocol/non-technical-umips/41). The post should outline the key components of a proposal and give the community a chance to submit feedback and recommend changes.

An example submission is [Polymarket's Liquidity Mining Program](https://discourse.umaproject.org/t/revised-funding-request-for-liquidity-mining-program-extension-from-polymarket/1716).

**Step 2: Snapshot Vote**

When the proposal appears ready, a Discourse poll can be created by the proposer with a 5 day close. Should it receive majority support at the end of 5 days, it will then pass to snapshot for an indicative vote prior to being put to an on-chain vote.

Proposals that require movement of treasury funds require a 4,000 UMA bond to be posted which is returned if the proposal is successful in an on-chain vote of tokenholders.

RiskLabs, the foundation which established UMA, has indicated its willingness to handle the on-chain proposal and cover the bond payment for proposals which attract majority support on a snapshot poll of tokenholders.

Here is the snapshot for [Polymarket's Liquidity Mining Program](https://discourse.umaproject.org/t/revised-funding-request-for-liquidity-mining-program-extension-from-polymarket/1716).

**Step 3: On-chain Vote**

After a Snapshot vote has successfully passed, an on-chain vote is held to transfer the funds. If the vote is successful, the funds are transferred to the recipient wallet address.
