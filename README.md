# UMA Protocol

UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMAâ€™s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets.

UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. For information about Outcome, a DAO tooling platform built on UMA that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens and optimistic governance, refer [here](https://www.outcome.finance/). For information about Across, a cross-chain asset bridge secured by UMA, refer [here](https://across.to/).
