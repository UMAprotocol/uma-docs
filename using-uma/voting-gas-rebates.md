# Voting Gas Rebates

Risk Labs currently provides gas rebates for voters who have staked 500 or more UMA to encourage more community members to participate in securing the Optimistic Oracle.&#x20;

* Rebates cover the gas cost for commit and reveal transactions and are denominated in ETH.
* Voters must have at least 500 UMA staked at the start of the commit period for that voting period's commit and reveal transactions to be rebated.
* Commited votes must be revealed to be rebated.
* If a voter commits more than once on a dispute, only the first commit will be rebated.
* If a delegate address is used to vote, the rebate will be sent to the delegate address.
* Rebates are calculated for one calendar month and are sent out within the first half of the following month. Announcements are made in the UMA Discord at the time each rebate is sent out.
