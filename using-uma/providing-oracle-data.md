# Proposing Oracle Data

This tutorial describes how to propose answers to data requests. The data could be anything from token prices, to who won a basketball game, to whether an optimistic governance action is valid.

**Step 1:** Go to the [Optimistic Oracle dApp](https://oracle.umaproject.org/), if you are answering requests on a live network like Ethereum, Optimism, or Polygon, or go to the [Testnet dApp](https://testnet.oracle.umaproject.org/) if you are answering requests (probably your own) on Goerli.

**Step 2:** Locate requests under the Requests tab for outstanding requests.

**Step 5:** Before proposing, confirm the details of the request and ancillary data to ensure you are proposing accurate data. You may also want to check the instructions in the [UMIP](https://docs.umaproject.org/resources/approved-price-identifiers) for the identifier.
