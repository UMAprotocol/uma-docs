# Discord Summaries

The Voterdapp contains a useful helper tab "Discussion Summary" which contains a summary of Discord comments posted to the evidence rational channel. The summary system tries to best represent all view points presented in the discord comments, while removing noise and condensing duplication. The system leverages batched summaries to minimize the impact of context rot when processing many comments.

The summarized arguments are meant to make the voting process easier and quicker, but there is still risk that the model makes a mistake or misses a comment. **Users should verify against the actual discord comments to protect against this.**
