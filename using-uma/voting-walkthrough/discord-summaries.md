# Discord Summaries

The Voterdapp contains a "Discussion Summary" tab with an LLM summary of Discord comments on the vote. The summary removes duplicate arguments across all comments to give voters an overview of all arguments which is useful for long or spammed comment threads. The summary does not fact check comments, add additional arguments, or give voting recommendations.&#x20;

Voters should always verify all arguments included in the summaries with their own research. The raw comments are also provided in the "Discord Comments" tab so voters can review them against the summary in case of LLM error.
