# Voter Guide

* Read through the vote Description under the Details tab. Carefully review how the vote should resolve and if provided, the timing of when the request can resolve and any listed sources.
* Review the Timestamp under the Details tab. This is the point in time at which the vote should be evaluated.
* The vote Discussion tabs lists comments from the UMA Discord with arguments, resources, and suggested votes that may be helpful. **However, some commenters may try to influence the vote for their own profit. Always ​independently verify​ any claims before relying on them.**
* **For prediction market votes, it is helpful to review the market odds over time to sanity check your vote.** The market odds after an event has expired are a reflection of how bettors with skin in the game think a market should resolve. You should not vote based on the market odds, but if you are planning on voting against strong market odds you may want to do extra research to ensure your vote is correct.
