# Approved Price Identifiers

This table includes identifiers that could be useful for new contracts and are likely to be encountered by proposers, disputers, and voters. It does not include identifiers that have been deprecated, identifiers that have fallen out of use, or specific token pairs.

If you need an identifier that is not included in this list, you can [submit a new UMIP](https://docs.umaproject.org/community/governance/the-umip-process) for approval. If a price request is made with an identifier that is not on this table, please refer to the canonical [UMIP directory](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/tree/master/UMIPs) on GitHub. The absence of an identifier from this table does _not_ necessarily mean the identifier is not approved, it just means it is not recommended for new contracts.

If you want to use an approved identifier that is not on this list, let us know and we can add the identifier back to this table for easier voter/disputer reference.
